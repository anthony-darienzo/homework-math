# homework-class
This needs to go into the local tex distribution. On macos, this should be:
`/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex`

On linux, good luck. It should be in the home directory.

As of April 2022, I added a makefile to automate installing `homework-math.cls`
into the appropriate directories. This is custom to my set-up. If anyone sees
this repository, note that the makefile should be edited appropriately.
